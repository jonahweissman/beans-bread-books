Mushy and uninspired, $5. But worth every penny because while I was there I pilfered 5 packets of ketchup, mustard and relish, which have increased the palatability of my beans dramatically. Much needed.</description></item><item><title>Chicago</title><link>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/chicago/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Aug 2022 19:49:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/chicago/</guid><description>Chicago was great!

I&amp;rsquo;m reading The Unbearable Lightness of Being by Milan Kundera. My ebook is in a fixed width font, like a printout from the 90s.</description></item><item><title>Bread bag</title><link>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/2022-08-26T1422-0400/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/2022-08-26T1422-0400/</guid><description>I use a paper bag for my bread to regulate the humidity. Without a bag, it would dry out too quickly, but a plastic bag can trap too much humidity and cause unwanted mold. Before plastic bags displaced them, paper bags were the most popular choice for carrying food from the grocery store.1

We passed the other Cardinal train, heading in the opposite direction. And I tried my beans and bread! The beans are very salty, but the flavor is complex enough to keep me entertained.
