I started Ministry for the Future by Kim Stanley Robinson last night. It&amp;rsquo;s an explicitly longtermist sci fi book (although focused on a very short time horizon so far) about responses to climate change. It is the best pairing with my beans so far because my beans inspire the same sense of fear for the future and need for perseverance, modulated by human intervention (ketchup and garlic), as the book.</description></item><item><title>Bread bag</title><link>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/2022-08-26T1422-0400/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/2022-08-26T1422-0400/</guid><description>I use a paper bag for my bread to regulate the humidity.

We passed the other Cardinal train, heading in the opposite direction. And I tried my beans and bread! The beans are very salty, but the flavor is complex enough to keep me entertained. The bread (baked last night) is delicious.</description></item><item><title>Leaving Charlottesville</title><link>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/2022-08-26T1337-0400/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/2022-08-26T1337-0400/</guid><description>My train to Chicago (number 51) is running an hour and a half late :(</description></item></channel></rss>
