I read another speed reading chapter and learned to use my finger to set the pace of reading. It definitely speeds me up, but it&amp;rsquo;s kind of tiring. I could see it getting easier with practice.
Also, I&amp;rsquo;m in Missouri. I should reach Kansas City in a few hours.</description></item><item><title>beautiful Appalachia</title><link>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/2022-08-26T1740-0400/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/2022-08-26T1740-0400/</guid><description>rolling through the countryside, the scenery is lovely
I&amp;rsquo;m reading The Unbearable Lightness of Being by Milan Kundera. My ebook is in a fixed width font, like a printout from the 90s.</description></item><item><title>train 51 departed Charlottesville</title><link>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/2022-08-26T1527-0400/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/2022-08-26T1527-0400/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m on my way!
