I got lunch at Frontera Grill in River North with a friend. Had some mushroom tacos with black beans.
Now I&amp;rsquo;m on my way to Richmond, CA. I&amp;rsquo;m reading American Gods by Neil Gaiman.</description></item><item><title>Responses to Reader Questions</title><link>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/responses-to-reader-questions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Aug 2022 08:53:09 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/responses-to-reader-questions/</guid><description>what books pair best with your beans
I started Ministry for the Future by Kim Stanley Robinson last night. It&amp;rsquo;s an explicitly longtermist sci fi book (although focused on a very short time horizon so far) about responses to climate change.

I read another speed reading chapter and learned to use my finger to set the pace of reading. It definitely speeds me up, but it&amp;rsquo;s kind of tiring. I could see it getting easier with practice.
Also, I&amp;rsquo;m in Missouri. I should reach Kansas City in a few hours.</description></item><item><title>beautiful Appalachia</title><link>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/2022-08-26T1740-0400/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/2022-08-26T1740-0400/</guid><description>rolling through the countryside, the scenery is lovely
I&amp;rsquo;m reading The Unbearable Lightness of Being by Milan Kundera. My ebook is in a fixed width font, like a printout from the 90s.</description></item><item><title>train 51 departed Charlottesville</title><link>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/2022-08-26T1527-0400/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/2022-08-26T1527-0400/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m on my way! I get to see Charlottesville from a different perspective on the way out. First book on my list: Breakthrough Rapid Reading by Peter Kump. I&amp;rsquo;ll be reading one chapter per day as recommended.</description></item></channel></rss>
