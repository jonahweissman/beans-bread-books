Thanks to Tanner

# set up

1. Change CNAME entry for custom Domain Name
2. Set deployment branch to be "gh-pages"
  - this is the output of the github action
3. Change baseURL in config.yaml
  - change other settings if you want 
  - the poem type means that lines breaks are as they are in the text
