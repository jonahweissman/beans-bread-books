Apparently the problem in Elko was Union Pacific was rebuilding a train in a rail yard and blocked the main line for 4 hours for no reason.
News:
they gave us free rice (an indicator that they will give me a $200 voucher for the delay) the train had to stop to let someone with a medical issue get off a bunch of people were helping out this dude on the train who only spoke Spanish and had just been robbed, trying to make sure he had a place to stay, very wholesome 72 people boarded the train in Reno and a lot in the towns between there and Sacramento too This is my last post for this trip.</description></item><item><title>Delayed in Nevada</title><link>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/delayed-in-nevada/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Dec 2022 15:25:58 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/delayed-in-nevada/</guid><description>Up until this morning, this train had been exceptionally punctual. We waited in Grand Junction, CO for an extra 20 minutes because we were too early. Unfortunately, we ran into some trouble in a Union Pacific yard in Elko, NV. Amtrak delay events tend to be correlated with each other. The rail yard delay meant that our crew ran out of their federally mandated 12 hour maximum shift length before we got to Reno to pick up the next crew.</description></item><item><title>Frontera Grill</title><link>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/frontera-grill/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Dec 2022 15:31:01 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/frontera-grill/</guid><description>My train arrived early in Chicago. I got lunch at Frontera Grill in River North with a friend. Had some mushroom tacos with black beans.
Now I&amp;rsquo;m on my way to Richmond, CA. I&amp;rsquo;m reading American Gods by Neil Gaiman.</description></item><item><title>Here I Go Again</title><link>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/here-i-go-again/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Dec 2022 16:29:15 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/here-i-go-again/</guid><description>I am on the Capital Limited (train 29) to Chicago. Here is a list of things that make this trip different:
My trip begins in DC (this shaves a couple of hours and like $50 off of the trip) It is winter (previous trips have been in the summer). I will provide updates on if this changes my experience at all I have left my beans intact and added less brine.</description></item><item><title>Extra Day in the Windy City</title><link>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/extra-day-in-the-windy-city/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Sep 2022 00:52:03 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/extra-day-in-the-windy-city/</guid><description>I got in to Chicago nine hours late. They&amp;rsquo;re putting me up in a nice hotel and I&amp;rsquo;ll get to have lunch with my friend here. And I&amp;rsquo;ll probably get a hefty voucher for my trouble.

In the meantime, I bought some snap peas, a nectarine, and Grill Mates® Roasted Garlic &amp;amp; Herb Seasoning. I walked to the western edge of town. I went to Green River State Park, a glorified boat ramp and RV park. I looked at the poorly written educational signage outside the John Wesley Powell River History Museum.</description></item><item><title>Returning to Charlottesville</title><link>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/returning-to-charlottesville/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Sep 2022 16:55:40 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/returning-to-charlottesville/</guid><description>I am sitting on the California Zephyr, train 6 to Chicago. The familiar rumble of the tracks is gone, the train sits still. We await the cargo train ahead of us. Its crew is walking the length of the mile plus long train, looking for mechanical problems.
Part of my hesitancy to create a blog was a fear that I would be sucked into a world of gamified social interactions, that could mess with my incentives.</description></item><item><title>Visiting Mountain View</title><link>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/visiting-mountain-view/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Sep 2022 14:52:57 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/visiting-mountain-view/</guid><description>Today, I met with a friend of my dad for lunch in Mountain View. (I took Caltrain there and back.) Afterwards, I went to see the house of my birth and my home until I took the train across the country when I was one. Here it is:
And here&amp;rsquo;s a cool tree that was nearby:

When I open it, I&amp;rsquo;m hit with a wave of vapors that makes me recoil. It tastes like rubbing alcohol, even when mixed with ketchup.
Fortunately, I&amp;rsquo;ll arrive in only a few hours.</description></item><item><title>Leaving Los Angeles</title><link>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/leaving-los-angeles/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Aug 2022 10:02:22 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/leaving-los-angeles/</guid><description>After two hours in Los Angeles Union Station, the most unfriendly railroad station I&amp;rsquo;ve been in (they require you to show a ticket if you want to sit down), I&amp;rsquo;m on my way on the Coast Starlight (train 14). This is a new route for me. Service from L.A. to Seattle. Superliners, same as the Southwest Chief.</description></item><item><title>Responses to Reader Questions</title><link>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/responses-to-reader-questions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Aug 2022 08:53:09 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/responses-to-reader-questions/</guid><description>what books pair best with your beans
I started Ministry for the Future by Kim Stanley Robinson last night. It&amp;rsquo;s an explicitly longtermist sci fi book (although focused on a very short time horizon so far) about responses to climate change. It is the best pairing with my beans so far because my beans inspire the same sense of fear for the future and need for perseverance, modulated by human intervention (ketchup and garlic), as the book.</description></item><item><title>Update on Yesterday</title><link>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/update-on-yesterday/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Aug 2022 08:44:28 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/update-on-yesterday/</guid><description>I took some pictures yesterday that I didn&amp;rsquo;t end up posting.

I read another speed reading chapter and learned to use my finger to set the pace of reading. It definitely speeds me up, but it&amp;rsquo;s kind of tiring. I could see it getting easier with practice.
Also, I&amp;rsquo;m in Missouri. I should reach Kansas City in a few hours.</description></item><item><title>Vegan Blue Corn Tamale</title><link>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/vegan-blue-corn-tamale/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Aug 2022 00:48:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/vegan-blue-corn-tamale/</guid><description>I got a vegan blue corn tamale from the dining car. Mushy and uninspired, $5. But worth every penny because while I was there I pilfered 5 packets of ketchup, mustard and relish, which have increased the palatability of my beans dramatically. Much needed.</description></item><item><title>Chicago</title><link>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/chicago/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Aug 2022 19:49:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/chicago/</guid><description>Chicago was great!

I&amp;rsquo;m reading The Unbearable Lightness of Being by Milan Kundera.

Without a bag, it would dry out too quickly, but a plastic bag can trap too much humidity and cause unwanted mold. Before plastic bags displaced them, paper bags were the most popular choice for carrying food from the grocery store.1

We passed the other Cardinal train, heading in the opposite direction. And I tried my beans and bread! The beans are very salty, but the flavor is complex enough to keep me entertained. The bread (baked last night) is delicious.</description></item><item><title>Leaving Charlottesville</title><link>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/2022-08-26T1337-0400/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/2022-08-26T1337-0400/</guid><description>My train to Chicago (number 51) is running an hour and a half late :(</description></item><item><title>train 51 departed Charlottesville</title><link>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/2022-08-26T1527-0400/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/2022-08-26T1527-0400/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m on my way!
