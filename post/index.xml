The familiar rumble of the tracks is gone, the train sits still. We await the cargo train ahead of us. Its crew is walking the length of the mile plus long train, looking for mechanical problems.
Part of my hesitancy to create a blog was a fear that I would be sucked into a world of gamified social interactions, that could mess with my incentives.</description></item><item><title>Visiting Mountain View</title><link>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/visiting-mountain-view/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Sep 2022 14:52:57 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/visiting-mountain-view/</guid><description>Today, I met with a friend of my dad for lunch in Mountain View. (I took Caltrain there and back.) Afterwards, I went to see the house of my birth and my home until I took the train across the country when I was one. Here it is:
And here&amp;rsquo;s a cool tree that was nearby:
And another, in San Jose, from earlier in the week:</description></item><item><title>Arrived, Safe and Sound</title><link>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/arrived-safe-and-sound/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Aug 2022 08:51:56 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/arrived-safe-and-sound/</guid><description>My train ended up being half an hour late, not bad.</description></item><item><title>Beans Are Now Alcoholic</title><link>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/beans-are-now-alcoholic/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Aug 2022 16:37:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/beans-are-now-alcoholic/</guid><description>My bag of beans is now rapidly swelling with gas. When I open it, I&amp;rsquo;m hit with a wave of vapors that makes me recoil. It tastes like rubbing alcohol, even when mixed with ketchup.
Fortunately, I&amp;rsquo;ll arrive in only a few hours.</description></item><item><title>Leaving Los Angeles</title><link>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/leaving-los-angeles/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Aug 2022 10:02:22 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/leaving-los-angeles/</guid><description>After two hours in Los Angeles Union Station, the most unfriendly railroad station I&amp;rsquo;ve been in (they require you to show a ticket if you want to sit down), I&amp;rsquo;m on my way on the Coast Starlight (train 14). This is a new route for me. Service from L.A. to Seattle. Superliners, same as the Southwest Chief.</description></item><item><title>Responses to Reader Questions</title><link>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/responses-to-reader-questions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Aug 2022 08:53:09 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/responses-to-reader-questions/</guid><description>what books pair best with your beans
I started Ministry for the Future by Kim Stanley Robinson last night. It&amp;rsquo;s an explicitly longtermist sci fi book (although focused on a very short time horizon so far) about responses to climate change. It is the best pairing with my beans so far because my beans inspire the same sense of fear for the future and need for perseverance, modulated by human intervention (ketchup and garlic), as the book.</description></item><item><title>Update on Yesterday</title><link>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/update-on-yesterday/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Aug 2022 08:44:28 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/update-on-yesterday/</guid><description>I took some pictures yesterday that I didn&amp;rsquo;t end up posting.

I went to the grocery store and got some garlic, spinach and a peach. The train is on time.</description></item><item><title>Done With the Unbearable Lightness of Being</title><link>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/done-with-the-unbearable-lightness-of-being/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Aug 2022 02:45:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/done-with-the-unbearable-lightness-of-being/</guid><description>I finished The Unbearable Lightness of Being and now I&amp;rsquo;m reading Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Life. I read another speed reading chapter and learned to use my finger to set the pace of reading. It definitely speeds me up, but it&amp;rsquo;s kind of tiring. I could see it getting easier with practice.
Also, I&amp;rsquo;m in Missouri. I should reach Kansas City in a few hours.</description></item><item><title>Vegan Blue Corn Tamale</title><link>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/vegan-blue-corn-tamale/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Aug 2022 00:48:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/vegan-blue-corn-tamale/</guid><description>I got a vegan blue corn tamale from the dining car. Mushy and uninspired, $5. But worth every penny because while I was there I pilfered 5 packets of ketchup, mustard and relish, which have increased the palatability of my beans dramatically. Much needed.</description></item><item><title>Chicago</title><link>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/chicago/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Aug 2022 19:49:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/chicago/</guid><description>Chicago was great!

I&amp;rsquo;m reading The Unbearable Lightness of Being by Milan Kundera. My ebook is in a fixed width font, like a printout from the 90s.</description></item><item><title>Bread bag</title><link>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/2022-08-26T1422-0400/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/2022-08-26T1422-0400/</guid><description>I use a paper bag for my bread to regulate the humidity. Without a bag, it would dry out too quickly, but a plastic bag can trap too much humidity and cause unwanted mold. Before plastic bags displaced them, paper bags were the most popular choice for carrying food from the grocery store.1

We passed the other Cardinal train, heading in the opposite direction. And I tried my beans and bread! The beans are very salty, but the flavor is complex enough to keep me entertained. The bread (baked last night) is delicious.</description></item><item><title>Leaving Charlottesville</title><link>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/2022-08-26T1337-0400/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/2022-08-26T1337-0400/</guid><description>My train to Chicago (number 51) is running an hour and a half late :(</description></item><item><title>train 51 departed Charlottesville</title><link>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/2022-08-26T1527-0400/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/2022-08-26T1527-0400/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m on my way!
