I finished _The Unbearable Lightness of Being_ and now I'm reading _Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Life_. I read another speed reading chapter and learned to use my finger to set the pace of reading. It definitely speeds me up, but it's kind of tiring. I could see it getting easier with practice.

Also, I'm in Missouri. I should reach Kansas City in a few hours.
