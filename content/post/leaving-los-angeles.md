After two hours in Los Angeles Union Station, the most unfriendly railroad station I've been in (they require you to show a ticket if you want to sit down), I'm on my way on the Coast Starlight (train 14). This is a new route for me. Service from L.A. to Seattle. Superliners, same as the Southwest Chief.
