Several updates: we passed Afton mountain and entered the Shenandoah valley. We passed the other Cardinal train, heading in the opposite direction. And I tried my beans and bread! The beans are very salty, but the flavor is complex enough to keep me entertained. The bread (baked last night) is delicious.
