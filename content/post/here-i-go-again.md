I am on the Capital Limited (train 29) to Chicago. Here is a list of things that make this trip different:

- My trip begins in DC (this shaves a couple of hours and like $50 off of the trip)
- It is winter (previous trips have been in the summer). I will provide updates on if this changes my experience at all
- I have left my beans intact and added less brine. To compensate for the less fermentation-friendly environment, I have added sauerkraut and pickled radishes (and one chunk of beet). I hope that these vegetables will provide a suitable advantage to the lactic acid bacteria before any nasty stuff can get a foothold.
- I moved out of my apartment and into a storage unit before leaving. On the return trip, I shall do the reverse but into a different apartment.
- This time I am carrying two backpacks: one for work and one for fun.

This concludes the list. Thank you for reading.
