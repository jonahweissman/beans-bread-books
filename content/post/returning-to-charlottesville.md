I am sitting on the California Zephyr, train 6 to Chicago. The familiar rumble of the tracks is gone, the train sits still. We await the cargo train ahead of us. Its crew is walking the length of the mile plus long train, looking for mechanical problems.

Part of my hesitancy to create a blog was a fear that I would be sucked into a world of gamified social interactions, that could mess with my incentives. It's already a little weird sharing my experiences publicly in real time. I'm flattered that people expressed interest in a place for readers to respond to this blog publicly, and I'm grateful for the comments and questions I received after creating the guestbook. I imagined the guestbook to be a way for readers to respond to the blog as a whole; the decision to not have a comment section on each post was a deliberate strategy to avoid polluting how I think about posts. I don't want it to be easy for me to categorize posts by the amount of engagement they get because I think it will push me towards writing posts that get more and longer comments.So what is the guestbook for? If I'm getting any reader feedback, won't that incentivize me to give readers what they want? Why is that a bad thing? I don't have a clear vision here, but I'm trying to avoid a social media vibe.

This is what my grandmother imagined I might see on my previous train trip:

I kept my leftover beans from last trip. Here's what they looked like after a month. They tasted pretty decent.

This time, I'm using dehydrated beans. They have worse flavor and texture, but they are less messy and they require less specialized knowledge to create.
