We arrived here at 11:30 MDT and we're expected to depart at 5:00 MDT. In the meantime, I bought some snap peas, a nectarine, and Grill MatesÂ® Roasted Garlic & Herb Seasoning. I walked to the western edge of town. I went to Green River State Park, a glorified boat ramp and RV park. I looked at the poorly written educational signage outside the John Wesley Powell River History Museum.
