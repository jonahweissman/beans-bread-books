The delay has turned into 5Â½ hours. Apparently the problem in Elko was Union Pacific was rebuilding a train in a rail yard and blocked the main line for 4 hours for no reason.

News:
- they gave us free rice (an indicator that they will give me a $200 voucher for the delay)
- the train had to stop to let someone with a medical issue get off
- a bunch of people were helping out this dude on the train who only spoke Spanish and had just been robbed, trying to make sure he had a place to stay, very wholesome 
- 72 people boarded the train in Reno and a lot in the towns between there and Sacramento too
- This is my last post for this trip. Thanks for reading!
