> what books pair best with your beans

I started _Ministry for the Future_ by Kim Stanley Robinson last night. It's an explicitly longtermist sci fi book (although focused on a very short time horizon so far) about responses to climate change. It is the best pairing with my beans so far because my beans inspire the same sense of fear for the future and need for perseverance, modulated by human intervention (ketchup and garlic), as the book.

> How has your dream life changed while in transit?

I wish I could recall some specific dreams to share. Short of that, all I can say is that I much more aware of the edge of sleep, when the sounds and spaces in my waking awareness start taking on new meanings until they dissolve into irrelevance.

> Have you encountered any strange or intriguing people?

>  I would also like to hear about the people you're traveling with

On both the Cardinal and the Southwest Chief, I had no seatmate for most of the time, so I haven't been forced to interact with anyone. It's always interesting watching the Amish and seeing how identically dressed they are at all ages, within each gender.

> What ratio of relish to ketchup to mustard would you recommend to bring out the beansâ€™ subtler notes of koji without overpowering them?

The packets are pretty small, but one is enough to flavor an entire slice of bread+beans. I don't want to have half open condiment packets (I've had enough spillage of beans as is) so I have not mixed any so far. The subtle koji notes are hard to notice in the first place. I used about 10% as much koji as the miso recipe recommended because that's all I had on hand at the time.

> how you manage to sleep sitting up

It's really not bad. The seats recline very far and the leg rest helps a lot. I'm also pretty tired each day, and the train noises are very rhythmic. I've gotten pretty lucky with other people being quiet at night.
