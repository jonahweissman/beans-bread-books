We waited in Grand Junction, CO for an extra 20 minutes because we were too early. Unfortunately, we ran into some trouble in a Union Pacific yard in Elko, NV. Amtrak delay events tend to be correlated with each other. The rail yard delay meant that our crew ran out of their federally mandated 12 hour maximum shift length before we got to Reno to pick up the next crew. So we sat in the Nevada desert for an hour while we waited for the Reno crew to drive over and take over operations.\nOtherwise, things are going well. I finished American Gods. Entertaining book, it reminded me of Snowcrash by Neil Stephenson. Now I\u0026rsquo;m reading Better Never to Have Been by David Benatar. It\u0026rsquo;s interesting, but he\u0026rsquo;s really optimizing for tight argumentation rather than readability. It\u0026rsquo;s not overly technical, but he\u0026rsquo;s spending a lot of time early on anticipating objections that I don\u0026rsquo;t have. My bean supply is holding up well.\n","permalink":"https://beansbreadbooks.jonahweissman.com/post/delayed-in-nevada/","summary":"Up until this morning, this train had been exceptionally punctual.
